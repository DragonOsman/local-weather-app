# local-weather-app

This is a local weather app I made for Free Code Camp.  It uses their weather API to get the weather data.  I display the main weather info along with the weather icon, including the humidity, wind speed, wind pressure, and temperature, as well as the city and country name from the Free Code Camp weathe API.
